# VNPU HAL and CLI

Status: Milestone 4 design specification.

This document defines the C++ hardware abstraction layer (HAL) contract for
VNPU userspace software. The HAL sits above the Linux driver UAPI and hides raw
`ioctl`, file descriptor, and revision-specific details from applications and
validation tests.

## Scope

Milestone 4 provides a clean userspace interface on top of `/dev/vnpu0`.

Required deliverables:

- `IVnpuDevice` public interface;
- `LinuxVnpuDevice` backend using the Linux driver UAPI;
- `MockVnpuDevice` backend for deterministic unit tests without QEMU;
- structured error model;
- `vnpuctl` command-line tool with stable JSON output;
- GoogleTest coverage for HAL behavior;
- public API documentation.

The HAL must not expose MMIO register offsets or raw BAR access. Register-level
behavior remains documented in `docs/register_map.md`; driver userspace ABI
behavior remains documented in `docs/uapi.md` and `linux-driver/include/vnpu_uapi.h`.

## Architecture Position

C++ HAL: IVnpuDevice
      |
      +--> LinuxVnpuDevice -> /dev/vnpu0 ioctl -> Linux driver -> QEMU VNPU
      |
      +--> MockVnpuDevice  -> deterministic in-process backend
```

Tests above the HAL must use HAL or CLI concepts only. They must not hard-code
MMIO offsets, interrupt bits, or driver-private implementation details.

## Public Interface

The recommended public abstraction is:

```cpp
class IVnpuDevice {
public:
    virtual DeviceInfo get_info() const = 0;

    virtual DotProductResult run_dot_product(
        std::span<const std::int8_t> lhs,
        std::span<const std::int8_t> rhs,
        std::chrono::milliseconds timeout) = 0;

    virtual void reset() = 0;
    virtual void inject_fault(FaultType type) = 0;
    virtual DeviceStats get_stats() const = 0;

    virtual ~IVnpuDevice() = default;
};
```

The canonical C++ HAL header is `cpp-hal/include/vnpu/vnpu-hal.hpp`.
It should continue evolving toward this interface before the HAL is treated as
complete.

## Data Model

### `DeviceInfo`

`DeviceInfo` represents stable device identity and ABI information.

Required fields:

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `abi_version` | `std::uint32_t` | Linux UAPI ABI version, currently `1` |
| `device_id` | `std::uint32_t` | VNPU MMIO device signature, expected `0x564E5055` |
| `revision` | `std::uint32_t` | Hardware revision when exposed by the driver |
| `capabilities` | `std::uint32_t` | Reserved feature bitmap; `0` is valid |

The current UAPI header exposes `abi_version` and `device_id` through
`struct vnpu_info`. Until revision and capabilities are added to the UAPI, the
HAL must not invent feature support from missing fields.

### `DotProductResult`

`DotProductResult` represents one completed or failed dot-product request.

Required fields:

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `result` | `std::int32_t` | Signed INT32 dot-product result when status is OK |
| `driver_status` | enum | Driver-level status such as OK, timeout, or device error |
| `device_error` | `std::uint32_t` | Device error code reported by the driver |

The Linux backend maps this to `struct vnpu_dot_request`.

### `DeviceStats`

`DeviceStats` is diagnostic, not a performance ABI.

Required fields:

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `submitted` | `std::uint64_t` | Accepted run submissions |
| `completed` | `std::uint64_t` | Successful completions |
| `timed_out` | `std::uint64_t` | Timeout paths |
| `device_error` | `std::uint64_t` | Device-reported failures |
| `resets` | `std::uint64_t` | Reset operations |

The Linux backend maps this to `struct vnpu_status` and
`VNPU_IOCTL_GET_STAT`.

### `FaultType`

Required fault values:

| HAL value | Driver fault bit | Meaning |
|---|---:|---|
| `irq_drop` | bit 0 | Complete without raising an interrupt |
| `stuck_busy` | bit 1 | Keep the device busy until reset |
| `corrupt_result` | bit 2 | Deterministically alter the result |
| `force_error` | bit 3 | Complete with a device error |
| `none` | `0` | Clear fault injection |

Fault injection is test-only behavior. It must not be represented as a
production hardware feature.

## Linux Backend

`LinuxVnpuDevice` communicates with the kernel driver through `/dev/vnpu0`.

Required behavior:

- open the device node in the constructor or an explicit factory;
- close the file descriptor through RAII;
- use `VNPU_IOCTL_GET_INFO` for `get_info()`;
- use `VNPU_IOCTL_RUN_DOT` for `run_dot_product()`;
- use `VNPU_IOCTL_RESET` for `reset()`;
- use `VNPU_IOCTL_SET_FAULT` for `inject_fault()`;
- use `VNPU_IOCTL_GET_STAT` for `get_stats()`;
- translate `errno`, driver status, and device error into distinct C++ errors;
- avoid hidden retry unless a retry rule is explicitly documented.

The backend must validate request shape before issuing `ioctl`.

Revision-aware vector rules:

- `lhs.size() == rhs.size()`;
- Revision A supports only length `8`;
- Revision B supports length `8` and length `16`;
- inputs are signed INT8 values;
- length `8` inputs are packed into `struct vnpu_dot_request::input_a[0..1]`
  and `input_b[0..1]` in little-endian byte order;
- length `16` inputs use all four packed input words;
- unused upper input words must be written as zero for length `8`;
- `timeout` must be nonzero and within the driver-supported range.

Milestone 4 must keep the same public API for Revision A and B. Revision B
support must accept both length `8` and length `16`; requests for unsupported
lengths must fail with a structured unsupported-operation error.

## Mock Backend

`MockVnpuDevice` must support HAL unit tests without QEMU, a loaded kernel
module, or `/dev/vnpu0`.

Required behavior:

- return deterministic `DeviceInfo`;
- compute signed INT8 dot products in process;
- enforce the same public validation rules as `LinuxVnpuDevice`;
- simulate fault injection deterministically;
- update `DeviceStats` counters consistently;
- expose Revision A and Revision B behavior through constructor options or test
  fixtures.

The mock backend is not a replacement for integration testing. It exists to
make HAL behavior and error mapping testable in normal host unit tests.

## Error Model

The HAL must distinguish at least these categories:

| Category | Examples |
|---|---|
| validation error | mismatched vector sizes, unsupported length, invalid timeout |
| system error | `open`, `close`, or `ioctl` failing with `errno` |
| driver timeout | `VNPU_IOCTL_RUN_DOT` returns timeout status or `-ETIMEDOUT` |
| device error | device reports a fault/error code |
| unsupported operation | Revision B-only behavior requested on Revision A |

Applications and tests must be able to tell whether a failure came from caller
validation, the Linux syscall layer, driver timeout handling, or device fault
reporting.

## CLI

Executable name:

```text
vnpuctl
```

Required commands:

```bash
vnpuctl info --json
vnpuctl run-dot --input <json-file> --json
vnpuctl inject-fault irq-drop
vnpuctl inject-fault stuck-busy
vnpuctl inject-fault corrupt-result
vnpuctl inject-fault force-error
vnpuctl clear-faults
vnpuctl reset
vnpuctl stats --json
```

JSON output is the stable interface for pytest. Human-readable output may be
added, but automated validation must use JSON.

`run-dot` input must be read from a JSON file. This keeps validation vectors
reusable across manual tests, pytest, and CI.

Required `run-dot` input JSON shape:

```json
{
  "input_a": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8],
  "input_b": [8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1],
  "timeout_ms": 100
}
```

`input_a` and `input_b` contain signed INT8 values. Revision A input files must
provide exactly 8 elements per input vector. Revision B input files may provide
8 or 16 elements using the same field names. The CLI must reject mismatched
vector lengths, values outside the signed INT8 range, missing fields, and
nonpositive timeouts before issuing the HAL request.

Suggested JSON shapes:

```json
{
  "abi_version": 1,
  "device_id": 1447977045,
  "revision": 1,
  "capabilities": 0
}
```

```json
{
  "result": 36,
  "driver_status": "ok",
  "device_error": 0
}
```

```json
{
  "submitted": 1,
  "completed": 1,
  "timed_out": 0,
  "device_error": 0,
  "resets": 0
}
```

JSON field names must remain stable once pytest integration depends on them.

## Unit Test Requirements

GoogleTest coverage must include:

- reserved capability handling;
- Revision A fixed length `8`;
- Revision B length `8` and `16` behavior through the mock backend;
- unsupported length rejection;
- signed INT8 packing and dot-product correctness;
- timeout/fault error mapping;
- stats counter updates;
- RAII behavior for backend lifetime where practical.

The acceptance target is that HAL unit tests run without QEMU.

## Acceptance Criteria

Milestone 4 is complete when:

- application code uses HAL APIs and contains no register offsets;
- `LinuxVnpuDevice` and `MockVnpuDevice` exist;
- the HAL hides raw UAPI structure packing from callers;
- `vnpuctl` supports info, run, reset, fault injection, fault clearing, and
  stats;
- JSON output is stable and documented;
- validation errors, Linux syscall failures, driver timeouts, and device errors
  are distinguishable;
- HAL unit tests pass without QEMU;
- API documentation is present and matches the implemented public interface.

## Current Gaps

As of this document, `cpp-hal` only contains an initial stub:

- `include/vnpu/vnpu-hal.hpp` now defines `IVnpuDevice`;
- `src/vnpu-hal.cpp` has empty function bodies;
- no Linux backend, mock backend, CLI, or tests are implemented yet.

These gaps should be closed before marking Milestone 4 complete in
`PROJECT_STATUS.md`.
